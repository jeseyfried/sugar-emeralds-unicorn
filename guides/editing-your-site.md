Here are the basic process for editing a page and adding a new page. All steps start from your repository home page in GitHub.

## Editing a page
Let's make a simple change to the homepage (your `index.md` file).
- Click on the `index.md` file.
- Click on the edit icon (looks like a pencil)
- Make some change to the text.
- Hit the green Commit button near the bottom of the page.
- Wait a few minutes and refresh your webpage.

## Add a new page
- Click the Add file button
- Type in the filename, including a `.md` extension
- Hit the green Commit button near the bottom of the page

## Edit the navigation bar
Now we need to add the new page to the navigation bar
- Click on the `_includes` directory
- Click on `nav.html`
- Click on the edit icon (looks like a pencil)
- Duplicate (via copy and paste) on of the lines that contains a link to a page on your site
- Replace the old link with the name of the page you just created but WITHOUT the `.md` extension
- Hit the green Commit button near the bottom of the page
