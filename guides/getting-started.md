## Build a website in 10 minutes
- Create an account at [GitHub](http://github.com/register). Make note of your GITHUB-USERNAME.
- Rather than create everything from scratch, start with a basic set of core files.  Go to the [xanthan repository](http://github.com/fredgibbs/xanthan)
- Click the green "Use this Template" button
- Name your repository, which we call REPOSITORY below. You can always rename it later or delete it and start over.
- Go into the settings menu (the gear menu on the right of the top nav bar)
- On the left, click the link for "Pages".
- Under the Build & Deployment section, make sure GitHub Actions is selected.
- Note the URL that appears there in the form of http://GIHUB-USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY. Replace GITHUB-USERNAME with your GitHub username, and REPOSITORY with your repository name. Your final URL should loook like http://fwgibbs.github.io/xanthan
- Click on that URL, and you'll likely get a Page Not Found error.
- Wait a minute for GitHub to build your site, and refresh the page (Ctrl or Cmd R).

Congratualtions! You've made a website!
