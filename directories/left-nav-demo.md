Here you can see the left navigation bar!

Each page of student will will have a `toc-header` field in the metadata that specifies what category it should get listed under.

The left nav bar automatically finds all the pages in the `essays` (or whatever folder you'd like to use) and lists pages under the category specififed in the page's metadata.

This part of the page is where the student essay would go.
