## What is Xanthan?
Xanthan is a simple static website template that facilitates making a website that is hosted for free, always accessible, and easy to update via GitHub Pages. 

It provides a number of features for digital storytelling with a StoryMap-like interface. 

It's low-ish tech, which means that changes are a bit more technical than just editing a web form like on Wix or Squarespace. But no real technical skills are required.
