## A Research Story by Jonathan Seyfried

### Why did Matha Armagnac drink pulverized gemstones?
In the spring of 1375, Matha d’Armagnac, the Duchess of Girona, drank a solution made with pulverized emeralds as a key ingredient. If the gemstones worked as predicted by the apothecary, Matha’s pregnancy would result in the birth of a strong boy. In preparing the mixture, the apothecary, named Johan Davallano, learned the appropriate quantities of gemstones, but he also needed to trust the supply chain that brought the ingredients to his shop. 

The idea for this paper came to me last summer as I read Josep Roca i Heras’s 1929 biography of Joan I of Aragon. Roca i Heras, in his discussion of Joan’s marriage to Matha Armagnac, explained that Matha’s first child, born in June 1374, died within a few months. This experience led her to a more aggressive pharmaceutical regimen during her second pregnancy, including the potion made from precious gems.[^Josep María Roca i Heras, *Johan I d’Aragó* (Barcelona: Institució Patxot, 1929), 79] I located the archival source, which you can see here, a payment record to Johan Davallano dated June 1, 1375.

Looking at this record up-close, we can see Davallano’s name on the first line and then midway through, the price of thirty solidis for the first “polvora cordial en que entraren perles, safirs, maracdes, e altres pedres precioses.” I chose emeralds from this mixture for my study but I would certainly find interesting comparisons tracing the pearls and sapphires as well. 

In reading I had done previously about Joan I of Aragon, I knew that as Duke of Girona and later as King, Joan ingested water steeped in unicorn horn and possibly scrapings from it too. Unicorn, which we now know was actually narwhal tusk, possessed a reputation in the Late Middle Ages as a supremely powerful cure-all. My PhD Advisor, Michael A. Ryan, has argued that Joan's pursuit of unicorn horn played into a larger Mediterranean-wide spiritual economy that paralleled that of relics.[^Michael A. Ryan, “The Horn and the Relic: Mapping the Contours of Authority and Religiosity in the Late Medieval Crown of Aragon,” *Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural* 1, no. 1 (2012): 49–71]

### The Research Question: How did medieval apothecaries and merchants construct medical knowledge?
I wondered how Johan Davallano obtained the emeralds used in the potion for Matha and how Joan developed his understanding of the medical properties of unicorn horn. How did these commodities travel through trade networks to arrive in their hands? What kinds of documentation or relationships authenticated these substances as genuine? I had read two books that seemed to each provide half of the answers to these questions: *Out of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination* by Paul Freedman and *Trade, Trust, and Networks: Commercial Culture in Late Medieval Italy* by Gunnar Dahl.

Since both emeralds and unicorn horn came at high prices due to their rarity, I felt that I needed a more available substance as a useful comparison for my question about the construction of medical knowledge. Sugar came to mind, since during the Middle Ages it straddled the boundary between cuisine and medicine. Also, sugar arrived to the Mediterranean only in the Middle Ages; the ancient Greeks and Romans had used honey as their primary sweetener.[^Paul Freedman, *Out of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008), 22] 

### Three Commodities, Three Pathways to Medicine
Info about the pathways

Merchants and spicers were indeed agents of medicinal knowledge transfer for sugar, but less so for emeralds and unicorn horn. For emeralds, all signs point to a similar operation of trust through trade networks, like those described by Gunnar Dahl, but too specialized to have left much of a documentary record. For unicorn horn, however, the spicers and apothecaries got cut out of the equation. Elite actors transported this commodity of highest prestige and transferred knowledge of its properties.
